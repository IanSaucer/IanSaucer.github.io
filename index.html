                <h2>Problem Statement - Making Outfits</h2></a>
                <p>Many people struggle with putting together outfits that both look and
                    feel good. Others struggle with putting together new outfits and not
                    repeating old ones. An outfit can look great but not feel great on you
                    or adhere to your exact style preferences. Our app would allow you to
                    obtain your ideal clothing aesthetic using the articles of clothing you
                    already possess.</p>
